Another tileset for the game Cataclysm:Dark Days Ahead.

I started this tileset to contribute to the CDDA project and develop myself as an artist. The two main focuses of this tileset are readability and scale, so that, hopefully, the world feels more immersive for the player.

This is still in it's early phase and a WIP, but give it a look if you'd like.

Many thanks for @Fris0uman for handling all the programing black magic.
